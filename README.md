# data-space
this is an IBM Project, where i would take the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company. Space Y, that would like to compete with SpaceX. My job is to determine the price of each launch. I will do this by gathering information about Space X and creating dashboards for my team. I will also determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, I will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.
